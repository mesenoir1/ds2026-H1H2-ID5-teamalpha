### Decision: Initial project setup
We created the private repository for Topic H1+H2: XAI-Guided Training for Knee Osteoarthritis Grading. The project investigates whether saliency maps can identify knee X-ray cases where a CNN predicts the correct Kellgren–Lawrence grade for the wrong reason, and whether those cases can guide improved training.

### Decision: Dataset plan
We will use provided SilpaCS/kneeosteoarthritis dataset from Hugging Face. As a first step, we will inspect the dataset structure, class distribution across KL grades 0–4, image dimensions, and possible artifacts such as borders, cropping effects, or scanner marks.
